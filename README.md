“UniRide” is a secure, student-exclusive carpooling platform designed to combat high 
transport costs, unreliable public transport and campus congestion. It offers safety

updates. With features such as real-time seat availability, in-app chats, automated fair 
splitting, secure payments and driver/student ratings. Built with collaborative tools like 
Figma, GitHub, Trello, Flutter and Python – it follows an Agile model with principles of 
modularity, user-centred design, usability, iterative feedback and security. Deliverables 
include a functional prototype, documentation, UML diagrams, test reports, a demo and
