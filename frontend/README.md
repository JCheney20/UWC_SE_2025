# UniRide

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with `[create-expo-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).`

## Technologies Involved

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Language)
- [React Native] + [Expo](https://expo.dev) (Framework for building native apps)
- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) (UI Library)
- [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps) (Map Library)

## Get started

The package manager used is [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). I'd recommend using it for the project but you can use any package manager you want.

1. Install dependencies with your favourite package manager

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Would recommend using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for development. It's just easier to setup and use rather than emulators.
