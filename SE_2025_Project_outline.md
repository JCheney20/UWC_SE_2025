## CSC 312 - Software Engineering Group Project 2025: Key Dates, Deliverables, and Steps

This project emphasizes the process and fundamentals of software engineering, including SE methods, principles, goals, umbrella activities, and tools, as well as group dynamics. The project will be graded continuously.

    *   **Producible:** **Project Description or Abstract (max 100 words) uploaded**.
    *   **Who:** Group leader.
    *   **Content:** What your project is about (aims/objectives), functionality/features/tasks, clear definition of the problem/issue, chosen SE process model, at least two relevant principles, methods, goals, and umbrella activities, proposed tools, realistic scope (functions, non-functional requirements), identified stakeholders (e.g., users), and tangible deliverables.

*   **Sunday 7 September 2025:**
    *   **Producible:** **User Model (Requirements and Analysis) document (PDF)**.
    *   **Content:** Identification of users' needs, a **User Model** (profile of end-users and tasks they can perform, modeled in a **UML Use-case diagram**), a **Mental Model** (userâ€™s mental image of the interface, e.g., online shop concept), and **Requirements Analysis** (identifying/modeling data, function, behavior using UML Use case and/or high-level Class/function diagrams). The document should include these suggested headings.

*   **Sunday 21 September 2025:**
    *   **Producible:** **Design Model document (PDF)** plus **Prototype Demo (MP4, max 3-min)**.
    *   **Design Model Content:** Data design (e.g., ERD if applicable), class design, architectural design, interface design, and component level design (e.g., pseudocode).
    *   **Prototype Content:** Demonstrates key functionality using a mockup tool (like Figma/Adobe XD) or actual program code/scripts. This can be a throw-away or evolving prototype.

*   **Sunday 12 October 2025:**
    *   **Producible:** **Implementation/Coding document (PDF)** and **Application Demo (MP4)**.
    *   **Implementation Document Content:** Details about the hardware and software tools (e.g., IDE like NetBeans, Eclipse) used for implementation.
    *   **Application Demo Content:** A video clip (with voice-over) demonstrating your system's/application's/app's key functionality (no need to show elementary items like registration).

*   **Sunday 26 October 2025 (Final Project Deadline):**
    *   **Producible:** **Testing/Completion document (PDF)**, **Project Presentation (MP4)**, **Application Demo (MP4)** (likely the same as the one from Oct 12, or an updated version), and **Other Items (PDF only)**.
    *   **Testing Document Content:** A new section entitled "Testing" detailing the application of at least one appropriate testing strategy to satisfy user requirements and uncover errors. This report should also include an honest reflection on the good and bad experiences of the process within your group.
    *   **Project Presentation (MP4) Content:** A video covering specific aspects, with one slide on each: group number/name/members, chosen application, requirements, design components, implementation details (functionality coding, database technologies), type of testing done, and SE aspects applied.
    *   **Other Items (PDF only):** Code, UML diagrams, designs, data, etc. (No ZIP files; no executable file/package needed as the demo covers this).

### Project Steps Outline

The project follows a structured approach with specific steps designed to expose you to software engineering processes and fundamentals.

*   **Step 1: Group Formation and Submission**
    *   **Action:** Group leader uploads group details (members' names, student numbers, group name) to iKamva.
    *   **Deadline:** Sunday 3 August 2025.

*   **Step 2: Project Description Definition**
    *   **Action:** Group leader uploads a brief project description.
    *   **Content Focus:** Aims, functionality, problem definition, chosen SE process model (e.g., Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral, Agile), relevant SE principles, methods, goals, umbrella activities (at least two from each aspect), proposed tools, scope, stakeholders, and deliverables.
    *   **Deadline:** Sunday 10 August 2025.

*   **Step 3: Initiating Project Work**
    *   **Action:** Begin working on the project, applying a selected SE Process model in a disciplined way.
    *   **Focus:** Incorporate UML (Use case diagrams, class diagrams, etc.) and apply SE principles, methods, goals, and umbrella activities.

*   **Step 4: User Model (Requirements and Analysis)**
    *   **Action:** Document the users' needs and the system's conceptual understanding.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **User Model:** A profile of end-users and their tasks, modeled with a UML Use-case diagram.
        *   **Mental Model:** The user's conceptual understanding of the interface (e.g., relating an online shop to a physical one).
        *   **Requirements Analysis:** Identifying and modeling data, functions, and behavior, using UML Use case and/or high-level Class (or function) diagrams.
    *   **Documentation:** Report in ACM conference format, checked by Turnitin and CopyLeaks.
    *   **Deadline:** Sunday 7 September 2025.

*   **Step 5: Design Model plus a Prototype**
    *   **Action:** Create the detailed design of the system and a demonstrable prototype.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Design Model:** Includes data design (e.g., ERD), class design, architectural design, interface design, and component level design (e.g., pseudocode).
        *   **Prototype:** Develop a demonstration of key functionality using a mockup tool or actual code, which can be a throw-away or evolving prototype.
    *   **Documentation:** Document SE aspects applied.
    *   **Deadline:** Sunday 21 September 2025.

*   **Step 6: Implementation/Coding**
    *   **Action:** Translate the design into actual code using a chosen development environment (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse).
    *   **Documentation:** Document the hardware and software tools used.
    *   **Focus:** Continue applying SE aspects.
    *   **Deadline:** Sunday 12 October 2025.

*   **Step 7: Testing/Completion**
    *   **Action:** Apply a testing strategy to ensure user requirements are met and errors are found, and prepare for final submission and presentation.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Add a new "Testing" section to your report.
        *   Provide an honest reflection on the good and bad experiences with the chosen process model within your group.
    *   **Documentation:** Prepare the final document, presentation, and demo videos.
    *   **Deadline:** Sunday 26 October 2025.

Think of these steps and deliverables as a **series of checkpoints along a road trip**. Each checkpoint (deadline) requires specific items (deliverables) to be completed and presented, ensuring you're making steady progress and building up all the necessary components for your final destination (the completed project). Just like a journey, the "road map" (SE process model) guides you, and documenting your experiences along the way helps you reflect and learn.
